# m:0x0 is the Fn key. The sleep, wireless on/off, and brightness media keys
# work out of the box with Fn+F4, Fn+5, Fn+8/9 respectivly
# This is actually kind of a problem because I would like to remap them
# I am using the propper mapping for music play/pause and next/prev, valume +/-
# and external display. For the buttons I would like to remap but can't, I'm
# using Ctrl+1 for my shutdown menu, Ctrl+2 for hybrid-sleep, etc. When possible
# the Ctrl+n mapping goes right under the Fn button I would like to use but can't
# 

# These ones use the proper keys, I just had to add them
